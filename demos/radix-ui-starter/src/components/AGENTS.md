# AGENTS.md — demo components

Rules for the component library under `demos/radix-ui-starter/src/components/`. The
root, demo, and `src/AGENTS.md` rules still apply.

## Tiers

Components live in five tiers. Place each component in the lowest tier that fits.

- **`base/`** — low-level primitives (`Box`, `Heading`, `Text`, `Icon`). `Heading` and
  `Text` replace raw text tags. `Box` is the token-driven structural primitive.
- **`ui/`** — Radix UI wrappers and generic UI primitives (`Button`, `TextField`,
  `DropdownMenu`, `Dialog`, `Avatar`, `ThemeSwitcher`).
- **`layout/`** — layout primitives only (`Container`, `VStack`, `HStack`, `Grid`, and the
  page shell: `PageLayout`, `PageHeader`, `PageBody`, `PageFooter`,
  `SiteNavigationHeader`).
- **`chat/`** — product-named components for the chat demo (`ChatPanel`, `ChatHeader`,
  `MessageList`, `Message`, `Composer`).
- **`demo/`** — product-named page compositions for the demo (`ComponentsDemo` and its
  sections).

Rules:

- Product-named components never live in `layout/` or `ui/`.
- Dependencies flow downward only: `chat` and `demo` may use `ui`, `layout`, and
  `base`; never the reverse.
- **No raw `h1`–`h6` or `p` in pages or components.** Typography goes through
  `base/Heading` and `base/Text` exclusively.

## Styling

- **Token-only CSS.** Use `var(--token)` for every color, size, radius, and shadow.
  Never write a raw value.
- **Mono for UI.** Every UI component uses `--font-family-mono`. Only `base/Heading`
  (display) and `base/Text` (base) use the other font families.
- **One unique class per component, prefixed by tier.** The root element carries one
  class: `base-<name>`, `ui-<name>`, `layout-<name>`, or `chat-<name>` (for example
  `ui-button`, never `.button`).
- **Scoped stylesheets.** Every rule in a component stylesheet is nested under the
  component's root class. Use native CSS nesting for states and descendants, so the
  file folds as one block. Compound Radix components with portals are the documented
  exception: pieces that are not descendants of the root (a dropdown trigger, a dialog
  overlay) use their own `ui-<component>__<part>` class and their own scoped block.
- **Named states are classes.** Every named state has an `is-<state>` class nested under
  the root (`.ui-button.is-loading`). When Radix exposes a state only as a `data-*`
  attribute, mirror it to the matching `is-*` class. Common states: `is-disabled`,
  `is-loading`, `is-active`, `is-open`, `is-selected`, `is-invalid`, `is-readonly`,
  `is-placeholder`.
- **Compose classes with `clsx()`** from `@lib/clsx`.
- **Page shell.** `PageLayout` is the `main` grid; `PageHeader`/`PageBody`/`PageFooter`
  are its `header`/`article`/`footer` rows and self-position by `grid-row`, so a page
  renders only the regions it needs. `PageBody` is the scroller; it attaches the scroll
  ref from `layout/page-scroll.ts`. `SiteNavigationHeader` collapses on scroll-down via
  `lib/scroll/useScrollDirection.ts`. Never nest a `<header>` inside another `<header>`:
  a page's own header block goes in `PageBody` (the `article`).

## The box surface

`base/Box` exposes the box aspects as enum props through `BoxProperties`: spacing
(`p`, `px`, `py`, `m`, `mx`, `my`), `border` and `borderColor`, `elevation`, `rounded`,
and `background`. A component consumes the surface in one of three modes.

1. **Inherit.** The props extend `BoxProperties`, and the component spreads the
   remaining props onto an internal `Box`. A caller can override every box aspect.
   `DialogContent` does this.
2. **Layout inherit.** A layout primitive extends `BoxProperties` and merges
   `boxClassNames(props)` into its own root class. `boxClassNames` always returns the
   root `base-box` class, so the aspect rules always match. `HStack`, `VStack`, `Grid`,
   and `Container` do this.
3. **Compose.** The component renders a `Box` internally and keeps its `DESIGN.md` look
   in CSS. The `Message` bubble does this.

A component that exposes a box aspect must not set that aspect in its own stylesheet.
`Box.css` and the component stylesheet have equal specificity, so the winner would
depend on import order. Set the default on the prop instead.

## Example

```tsx
import type * as React from "react";
import { clsx } from "@lib/clsx";
import "./Button.css";

interface ButtonProps {
	label: string;
	onClick: () => void;
	loading?: boolean;
	disabled?: boolean;
}

/**
 * Token-styled button. Named states are exposed as `is-*` classes.
 */
export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick, loading, disabled }) => (
	<button
		type="button"
		className={clsx("ui-button", { "is-loading": loading, "is-disabled": disabled })}
		disabled={disabled || loading}
		aria-busy={loading}
		onClick={onClick}
	>
		{label}
	</button>
);
```

```css
/* Button.css — every rule is scoped under .ui-button */
.ui-button {
	background: var(--color-brand-primary);
	color: var(--color-text-ondark);

	&.is-disabled {
		opacity: 0.5;
	}
}
```

## Tests

Component rendering tests are **intentionally omitted**. Radix UI primitives are
already tested upstream and this library only adds styling, so a DOM test of a wrapper
asserts little. Test pure logic (`src/lib/**`) and the per-theme token contract
instead. This is the documented exception to the root rule "one test per source".
